<h3>Meeting with Yuval - April 13, 2020</h3>

1. Even though there are certain benefits to cluster homogeniaty as a whole - it was agreed upon that using the greedy algorithm to assign clusters to researchers is actually a good metric (especially as we add mis-integration and mis-separation to help understand in what ways is the method succesful).
2. Besides for a final metric, he suggested we "see how each author is distributed by the clusters' which is basically identical to mis-separation, but will help see exactly what happened in a given case.
3. Finally, at-least in the LR model, we can use a single 'loss' - the F1 Score - to allow us to help tune the hyperparameters of the LR and clustering algorithm within a single pipeline.

<h3>Meeting with Etam - April 9, 2020</h3>

1. **Do: Look at the labeled dataset and see how many disambiguated authors we have and how many papers they have.**
2. ~~To discuss with Yuval about the scoring metric, whether to keep the applied metric or do something more generic (Wasserstein Distance)~~
